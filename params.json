This was the start of the idea and it soon became mashed up with all the great Firefox quick find features that Chrome is missing.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n###Description:\r\n- A next gen text search tool for your Chromium web page. Start a search and simply press enter/return on a highlighted link and you'll instantly navigate to that page. A mashup of Firefox quick find features (case match, links only search, highlight all, search selected text) as well as awesome new ones (scroll/navigate through all search results with context) - brought to Chrome and Opera. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n###Shortcut keys:\r\n\r\n####Getting started:\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">/</kbd>&nbsp; or  &nbsp;<kbd class=\"light\">ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class=\"light\">shift</kbd> + <kbd class=\"light\">f</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: forward slash or ctrl+shift+f will open Quick Find menu\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">'</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: single quote key will open Quick Find menu in links mode (only links are searched)\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">esc</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: escape key will close Quick Find menu\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n####Menu navigation:\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">&#8593;</kbd>&nbsp; or &nbsp;<kbd class=\"light\">&#8595;</kbd>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;: navigate results by using up or down arrow keys\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">enter</kbd>&nbsp; or &nbsp;<kbd class=\"light\">return</kbd> : pressing enter on highlighted menu with link will navigate to the link\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n####Search Options:\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">alt</kbd> + <kbd class=\"light\">a</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: toggle highlight all results mode\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">alt</kbd> + <kbd class=\"light\">c</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: toggle match case mode\r\n\r\n<kbd class=\"light\">alt</kbd> + <kbd class=\"light\">l</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: toggle links mode\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n####Tips:\r\n- Quick Find search box is prepopulated with any selected/highlighted text prior to opening the search menu.\r\n- Toggle occurs only when cursor focus is on the Quick Find menu.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n###Limitations:\r\n- Extension only works on sites that allow content scripts. The chrome webstore page itself for example doesn't even allow content scripts to be run.\r\n- Quick find does not search through iframes, script, or code html elements.\r\n- When results show up in same html element, will be shown only as one result.\r\n- Other website shortcuts or extensions may conflict with these shortcuts. A future enhancement can be to select your own shortcuts to open the menu.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n###Additional Notes\r\n- Anonymous page view tracking is used to improve the extension and user experience. You can opt out in the options menu.\r\n","google":"UA-34217520-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
